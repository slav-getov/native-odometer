This is a project for personal usage. Or for anyone interested.

I will try to document my development and usage to the best of my abilities.

# Issues and how they were resolved:

1. PagerViewer was not installed properly and so the build failed with: **Task :react-native-pager-view:compileDebugKotlin FAILED**

How was this resolved:
https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/1369 By following the final remark and re-building the android app.

## User experience and how the app works:

### Libraries used:

0. This list will grow (I hope)
1. [PagerViewer](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-pager-view)
